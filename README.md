# Seek Legal

**Seek Legal** is an Australian access-to-justice initiative committed to making legal information clearer, fairer, and more accessible for everyone.

This repository represents the **parent organisation and public hub** for a growing collection of free, plain-language legal resources created for Australians—starting with the **Criminal Injuries Compensation (CIC) Handbook**, and expanding into other areas of law over time.

## 🌏 Our Mission

Seek Legal exists to reduce barriers to justice by:

- Translating complex legal processes into **clear, practical guidance**
- Centralising **trusted, accessible legal resources** in one place
- Supporting people who may not have the means, confidence, or access to traditional legal services
- Promoting **legal literacy** so Australians can better understand their rights and options

We believe access to justice should not depend on income, background, or legal knowledge.

## 📚 What Seek Legal Is

- A **portfolio and umbrella organisation** for public legal resources
- A long-term project focused on **legal accessibility**, not profit
- A central hub that links to guides, toolkits, and explainers across different areas of law
- A platform designed to grow alongside community need

Seek Legal does **not** replace legal advice. Instead, it helps people understand _when_, _why_, and _how_ to seek help—and what to expect when they do.
